This is just a quick and dirty interactive UI for predicting TEM diffraction patterns. A few standard crystal structures are included (select one from the "structure" dropdown), and you can select an arbitrary crystal orientation by clicking the plot on the left. 

additional crystal structures can be added via "load more structures". example files for additional structures are provided
